Also, the README.md file should include at least a brief description of what HW1 is about. 

This HW is dealing with the 1985 Auto Imports Database.
We import the data, and tried different methods of importing, such as using read.csv and read_csv.
In addtion, we practiced some basic plotting. For example, histogram, barplot, boxplot, and star plot.
On the other hand, we did some summary according to the data set.
Also, we used PCA to analyze different combinations of the data.
